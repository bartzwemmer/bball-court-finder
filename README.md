# bball-court-finder
Poster project to move past all the hello world tutorials I did the past period. The goal is to xxtract basketball courts from satellite imagery, by building a Python tool following common design principles. Training data consists of Open Street Map (OSM) data to find locations of existing basketball fields in the Netherlands and the PDOK WMS Service for the Netherlands which is a true colour satellite image without cloud cover spanning the Netherlands.
